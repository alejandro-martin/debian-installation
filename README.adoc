== Debian Installation Guide

This is a personal guide to install a minimal _Debian_ with the _Gnome_ desktop,
quite general, but at the end is a personal guide and that's why it has some
custom configuration.

Hope it helps to you.

== Compiling

To compile the files into _HTML_ pages:

 sh build.sh

== Notes

 * Substitute _Vim_ for _Nano_ in any step if you haven't use _Vim_.
 * Grub is _boot loader_ which let the user decide which _operating system_ to boot,
 beetwen the installed ones.
 * For comfort, the _Gnome_ desktop configuration can be done first. Look at the
 _Debian Gnome Configuration_ part.
