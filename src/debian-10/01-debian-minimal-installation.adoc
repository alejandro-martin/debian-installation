= _Debian_ 10 basic installation with _Gnome_
â˜£ By Alejandro Martin

include::{include-dir}/version.adoc[]

* Used release is _Debian 10 - Buster_
* Sources and issues reports on https://github.com/alejandro-martin/debian-installation[Github, window="_blank"]

Guide for basic _Debian_ installation with _Gnome_ desktop.

<<<

== Minimal system installation

NOTE: All commands have to be run as superuser.

. Create bootable USB. If extra firmware(drivers) are needed, download them from _Debian_ repositories website and put _.ucode_ and _.fw_ files in the root of another USB.
. Boot system from USB. If _UEFI_ installation is needed, boot the USB in UEFI mode, and after keyboard configuration go to a new terminal(`ctrl+alt+f2`) and type:
+
 [ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo UEFI || echo Legacy
+
which it is going to print if the system was booted in _UEFI_ or _Legacy_ mode.
Return to installation with (`ctrl+alt+f1`).
+
. Follow installation steps and when you reach _Software Selection_ section, *ONLY* tick *_Standard System Utilities_* for a minimal system installation.
+
TIP: For more detailed info about this step, you can follow this https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/debian-minimal-server/[guide, window="_blank"].

. Reboot system and remove usb.

== Connect to a wireless network [Optional]

. Login as superuser:

 su -

. Look for the interface that will be used (_Wifi_ interfaces usally have a name like `wlan0` or `wlp1s0`):

 ip a

. Turn on the interface:

 ip link set INTERFACE_NAME up

. Look for a network to connect (replace interface name):

 iw INTERFACE_NAME scan | less

. Create a file with the network(replacing `NETWORK_NAME`). NOTE: After run
the command, the password has to be inmediately typed:

 wpa_passphrase NETWORK_NAME >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

. Init the connection, using `-B` flag to run on background:

 wpa_supplicant -B -i INTERFACE_NAME -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

. Get an ip address using _dhcp_ client:

 dhclient INTERFACE_NAME

. Test connection(ping to Google dns):

 ping 8.8.8.8

. In case is needed, to release ip type:

 dhclient -r

. This step is *no* needed, but if you want to turn off the interface:

 ip link set INTERFACE_NAME down

== Configure repositories

. Enter as superuser:

 su -

. Edit repositories file (*_nano_* editor is used here):

 nano /etc/apt/sources.list

. Comment the lines(add `#` at the beginning of line) if they start with `deb cdrom`.

. Add `contrib` and `non-free` packages, appending `contrib non-free` after `main` in each repository line

. Adjust mirror repository on each url based on your location,
look for it at _Debian_ https://www.debian.org/mirror/list[_Mirrors_ website, window="_blank"].

. [Optional] To use _Debian Testing_ distribution you should replace `stable` for `testing` on each line. For more information go to https://www.debian.org/releases/[_Debian Releases_ website, window="_blank"].
+
IMPORTANT: This step is only needed if the _Debian Testing_ release is desired.

. Save and quit(`ctrl+o`, `ctrl+x`).

. It may end up like this(replace `MIRROR` with you region):
+
.sources.list
----
 deb http://ftp.MIRROR.debian.org/debian/ stretch main contrib non-free
 deb-src http://ftp.MIRROR.debian.org/debian/ stretch main contrib non-free
 
 deb http://security.debian.org/ stretch/updates main contrib non-free
 deb-src http://security.debian.org/ stretch/updates main contrib non-free

 deb http://ftp.MIRROR.debian.org/debian/ stretch-updates main contrib non-free
 deb-src http://ftp.MIRROR.debian.org/debian/ stretch-updates main contrib non-free
----
+
. [Optional] If you want newer packages on a _stable_ release (from testing distribution, mostly)
you could append the _backports_ repositories:
+
.sources.list[fragment]
----

# ... previous sources ...

# backports
deb http://ftp.MIRROR.debian.org/debian/ stretch-backports main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.MIRROR.debian.org/debian/ stretch-backports main contrib non-free
----
+
NOTE: These are the "Stretch" _backports_ repositories. For more information look for the official
https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/[_backports instructions_, window="_blank"]. After each Debian stable_ release it will take a few days before _backports_ are available.
+
*Important*, to install any package from the backports, it has to be installed with:

 apt-get -t stretch-backports install "package"

== Update & Upgrade

. Update packages:

 apt-get update

. Upgrade packages:

 apt-get upgrade

. If testing repositories were added, it will need a _dist-upgrade_:

 apt-get dist-upgrade

== Add superuser privileges to main user

. Install `sudo` package

 apt-get install sudo

. Add user to group `sudo`(which is on file:
  with the permissions, replace USERNAME):
+
 adduser USERNAME sudo
+
As an alternative it can be used:
+
 usermod -a -G sudo USERNAME

TIP: These commands modify the `/etc/sudoers` file.


== Install firmware

. Install device linux firmware

 apt-get install firmware-linux firmware-linux-free firmware-linux-nonfree

. Install wifi firmware:
+
 apt-get install firmware-iwlwifi

== Install minimal _Gnome_ desktop

. Install display server(`xserver-xorg-core`), minimal gnome desktop(`gnome-core`)
  and gnome display manager(`gdm3`):

 apt-get install gnome-core gdm3

== Install Graphics card firmware

=== Install _Nvidia_ Drivers

. Install _Nvidia detect_ to identify the used nvidia card:
+
 apt install nvidia-detect
+
. Run command:
+
 nvidia-detect
+
NOTE: You will obtain a message like this image::img/nvidia-detect.png[Nvidia Detect]
+
. Install _Nvidia_ firmware, and follow the instructions:
+
 apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's/[^-]*-[^-]*-//') nvidia-driver
+

NOTE: Usually propietary drivers for Gpus have a better performance, they can be downloaded
from their own websites. *BUT* OS drivers have a better compatibillity with other software, _Steam_ for example.

=== Install _AMD_ Graphics Drivers

. Install _AMD_ graphics firmware:

 apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,') fglrx-driver

== Reboot

. Reboot system:

 reboot

IMPORTANT: After the installation you should verify that the _Debian_ partition is the primary boot
drive for your device in order to run the grub on multi-booting systems.
