== Automatically Mount Partition [Optional]

To mount other hard drives or partitions automatically at startup.

Mount _NTFS_ partition:

+
save and exit. _fstab_ file may look similar to:
+
.fstab
----
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
# / was on /dev/sda5 during installation
UUID=942b3e5e-2634-46c9-9ecd-86bea21ce534 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1
# /boot/efi was on /dev/sda2 during installation
UUID=D82A-C79C  /boot/efi       vfat    umask=0077      0       1
# swap was on /dev/sda6 during installation
UUID=94daf3fe-d750-4f10-96e4-5df4f99753bf none            swap    sw              0       0


#/dev/sdb1 /media/files ntfs-3g uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0

#/dev/sdb1 /media/files ntfs default 0 0

UUID=01D33276FAF0C850 /media/files ntfs-3g uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0022 0 0
----
+
where:

* `UUID` is the unique identifier of the partition.
* `/media/files` is the destination folder.
* `uid=1000,gid=1000` are the owners.

CAUTION: If partition cannot be mounted, system won't boot. This happens for
instance when windows has _fast boot_ option activated or if the storage is not available.
